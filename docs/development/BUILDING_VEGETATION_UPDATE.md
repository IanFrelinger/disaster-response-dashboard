# üè¢üå≥ Building Footprints & Vegetation Update

## Overview

The 3D terrain visualization has been significantly enhanced with realistic building footprints and comprehensive vegetation rendering. Buildings now have proper heights attached to them, and vegetation includes trees, forests, brush, and grass with realistic density and distribution.

## üè¢ Building Footprints with Heights

### **Building Types & Colors**
- **Commercial Buildings** (Blue): Tall office buildings and skyscrapers
- **Residential Buildings** (Tan): Houses and apartment complexes
- **Industrial Buildings** (Brown): Factories and warehouses
- **Government Buildings** (Red): Public facilities and government offices

### **Building Features**
- **Proper Height Scaling**: Buildings scale with elevation multiplier
- **3D Geometry**: Full 3D box geometry with realistic proportions
- **Building Labels**: Text labels showing building type
- **Shadow Casting**: Buildings cast and receive shadows
- **Type-based Materials**: Different colors for different building types

### **Sample Building Data**
```typescript
{
  id: 'building-1',
  coordinates: [-122.4194, 37.7749],
  height: 200,        // Height in meters
  width: 40,          // Width in meters
  length: 40,         // Length in meters
  type: 'commercial'  // Building type
}
```

## üå≥ Vegetation System

- **Shadow Casting**: All vegetation casts shadows
- **Density Control**: Configurable density for each type
- **Height Scaling**: Vegetation scales with elevation
- **Natural Distribution**: Random positioning for realism
