# 3D Holographic Waypoints Implementation Plan

## Overview

Transform the current 2D waypoint markers into 3D holographic-style waypoints that float above the routes, creating a futuristic command center experience similar to a holographic table view.

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design
- **Floating Effect**: Waypoints should appear to float above the terrain and routes
- **Holographic Appearance**: Semi-transparent, glowing effects with depth
- **3D Positioning**: Z-axis elevation to create floating appearance
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Subtle glow effects that respond to map interaction
- **Futuristic Styling**: Clean, modern appearance with command center aesthetics

### Technical Requirements
- **Mapbox GL JS 3D**: Utilize Mapbox's 3D capabilities for proper elevation
- **Custom Shaders**: Implement custom GLSL shaders for holographic effects
- **Depth Testing**: Ensure proper depth ordering with terrain and buildings
- **Performance**: Maintain smooth 60fps performance with multiple waypoints
- **Responsive**: Scale appropriately with zoom levels

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (3D Positioning)
- [ ] Update waypoint data structure to include elevation
- [ ] Implement 3D positioning using Mapbox's 3D coordinate system
- [ ] Add floating height calculations based on terrain elevation
- [ ] Test basic 3D positioning without visual effects

### Phase 2: Visual Effects (Holographic Styling)
- [ ] Create custom GLSL shaders for holographic appearance
- [ ] Implement semi-transparent materials with glow effects
- [ ] Add depth-based transparency and lighting
- [ ] Create floating animation effects

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Interactive Elements)
- [ ] Add hover effects and interaction feedback
- [ ] Implement dynamic lighting based on map state
- [ ] Add waypoint information panels
- [ ] Create smooth transitions and animations

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
- [ ] Integrate with existing route system
- [ ] Optimize performance for multiple waypoints
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Final testing and refinement

## Technical Approach

### 3D Coordinate System
```typescript
interface HolographicWaypoint {
  coordinates: [number, number, number]; // [lng, lat, elevation]
  floatingHeight: number; // Height above terrain
  holographicProperties: {
    opacity: number;
    glowIntensity: number;
    pulseRate: number;
    color: string;
  };
}
```

### Custom Shaders
- **Vertex Shader**: Handle 3D positioning and floating calculations
- **Fragment Shader**: Create holographic visual effects
- **Uniform Variables**: Control glow, transparency, and animation

### Mapbox Integration
- Use `fill-extrusion` layers for 3D waypoints
- Implement custom paint properties for holographic effects
- Add proper depth testing and layering

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] Waypoints appear at correct 3D positions
- [ ] Floating height calculations work correctly
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Holographic visual effects implemented
- [ ] Semi-transparent appearance with glow
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Proper depth ordering with terrain

### Phase 3 Success
- [ ] Interactive hover effects work
- [ ] Dynamic lighting responds to map state
- [ ] Information panels display correctly
- [ ] Smooth performance maintained

### Phase 4 Success
- [ ] Full integration with route system
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Production-ready implementation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- 3D coordinate calculations
- Elevation and floating height logic
- Shader compilation and validation

### Integration Tests
- Mapbox 3D layer integration
- Route and waypoint synchronization
- Performance benchmarks

### Visual Tests
- Holographic appearance validation
- Animation smoothness
- Depth ordering verification

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Mapbox 3D Limitations**: Fallback to 2.5D if full 3D not supported
- **Performance Issues**: Implement level-of-detail system
- **Shader Compatibility**: Provide fallback rendering modes

### Design Risks
- **Visual Clarity**: Ensure waypoints remain visible and readable
- **User Experience**: Maintain intuitive interaction patterns
- **Accessibility**: Provide alternative visual modes

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (Visual Effects)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (Interactive Features)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 days (Integration & Polish)

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-12 days

## Dependencies

- Mapbox GL JS 3D capabilities
- WebGL support for custom shaders
- Performance optimization techniques
- Existing route system stability
