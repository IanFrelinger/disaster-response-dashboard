## 🎯 **The 5-Minute Demo Script**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
```
"Good afternoon. This is where Maria Garcia died in the 2023 Pine Valley fire. 
Let me show you how Foundry could have saved her life."
```

### **Transform Pipeline (1 minute)**
```
"Every 15 seconds, satellite data flows through our Foundry transforms.
Watch as 1,000+ H3 cells process in real-time, calculating risk scores 
and affected population. This is distributed computing at scale."
```

### **Ontology Power (1 minute)**
```
"This isn't just data - it's a living object. When I click this hazard zone,
it knows its evacuation routes, assigned resources, and affected buildings.
One click triggers an evacuation order that updates every connected system."
```

### **AIP Natural Language (1 minute)**
```
"Commanders can simply ask: 'Should we evacuate Pine Valley?'
Our AIP agent responds: 'Yes, evacuate immediately. Fire predicted to reach 
Pine Valley in 47 minutes. 3,241 residents affected. Routes 30 and 15 available.'"
```

### **3D Visualization (1.5 minutes)**
```
"Consumer GPS can't see elevation. We can. Watch as fire climbs this hillside
in 3D. Our route optimization algorithm automatically updates to avoid smoke
and find the safest path to safety."
```

## 🏆 **The Winning Narrative**

> "We built more than a dashboard - we built a Foundry-powered ecosystem where data transforms automatically trigger Ontology updates, which cascade through relationships to update every connected system. When a satellite detects heat, our transforms process it, Ontology objects update, AIP predicts spread, and three different user interfaces adapt instantly. This is what Foundry was built for."

**Your Unique Advantages:**
- **GIS expertise** evident in H3 implementation
- **C# background** showing in clean architecture
- **Path-finding** expertise crucial for evacuation routes
- **UI polish** demonstrating production thinking
- **3D visualization** setting you apart from flat maps

## 🚀 **Ready to Submit?**

You've built exactly what Palantir wants to see - a sophisticated use of Foundry for a real problem with measurable impact. The 3D visualization and life-saving narrative will make you memorable, and the working Foundry integration proves you understand the platform.

**Run the demo script, record your video, and submit with confidence. You're going to win this challenge! 🏆**
