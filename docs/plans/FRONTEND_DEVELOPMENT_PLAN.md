## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (100% Coverage Target)
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('StatusCard', () => {
  it('should render safe status correctly', () => {
    render(<StatusCard status="safe" />)
    expect(screen.getByText('CURRENTLY SAFE')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
  
  it('should animate evacuate status', () => {
    render(<StatusCard status="evacuate" />)
    const card = screen.getByTestId('status-card')
    expect(card).toHaveClass('animate-pulse')
  })
})
```

### Integration Testing
```typescript
// Test component interactions
describe('PublicView Integration', () => {
  it('should update status when location is checked', async () => {
    render(<PublicView />)
    const input = screen.getByPlaceholderText('Enter your address...')
    fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: '123 Elm St' } })
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Check Status'))
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('EVACUATE NOW')).toBeInTheDocument()
    })
  })
})
```

### E2E Testing with Playwright
```typescript
// Complete user workflow testing
test('complete evacuation workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/public')
  await page.fill('[data-testid="address-input"]', '123 Elm St')
  await page.click('[data-testid="check-status"]')
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="status-card"]')).toHaveText('EVACUATE NOW')
  await page.click('[data-testid="checklist-item-1"]')
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="progress"]')).toHaveText('1/6')
})
```

### Smoke Testing
```typescript
// Critical path smoke tests
describe('Smoke Tests', () => {
  it('should load all views without errors', async () => {
    const views = ['/public', '/field', '/command']
    for (const view of views) {
      await page.goto(view)
      await expect(page.locator('body')).not.toHaveText('Error')
    }
  })
  
  it('should handle API failures gracefully', async () => {
    server.use(rest.get('/api/health', (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.status(500))
    }))
    await page.goto('/public')
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="error-boundary"]')).not.toBeVisible()
  })
