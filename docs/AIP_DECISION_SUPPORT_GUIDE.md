# AIP-Powered Decision Support 🤖

## Overview

The AIP Decision Support feature provides emergency commanders with an intelligent, natural language interface for making critical disaster response decisions. This feature demonstrates the power of AI-powered decision support in emergency management scenarios.

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Command Interface
- **Plain English Queries**: Ask questions in natural language without training
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI understands disaster response context
- **Example Queries**: Pre-built examples to get started quickly

### 2. Explainable AI Decisions
- **Clear Recommendations**: Not just "evacuate" but why evacuate
- **Confidence Levels**: Understand decision reliability (0-100%)
- **Data Sources**: See what information the AI used
- **Reasoning**: Understand the AI's thought process

### 3. Alternative Scenarios with Trade-offs
- **Multiple Options**: Explore different response strategies
- **Pros and Cons**: Clear analysis of each approach
- **Impact Assessment**: Understand consequences of each choice
- **Probability Scoring**: Likelihood of success for each scenario

## Example Usage

### Highway 30 Closure Scenario

**Commander Query**: "What happens if we lose Highway 30?"

**🤖 AIP Response**:
```
Recommendation: Immediate evacuation of Zone B required. Highway 30 closure 
would trap 3,241 residents. Alternative routes add 23 minutes to evacuation time.

Confidence: 94%

Data Sources:
• Traffic analysis system
• Population density data
• Fire spread model
• Route capacity assessment

Reasoning: Highway 30 is the primary evacuation route for Zone B. Closure 
analysis shows 3,241 residents would be trapped with only 2 alternative routes 
available. Fire spread model predicts 94% probability of route blockage within 
2 hours.
```

**Alternative Scenarios**:

1. **Maintain Highway 30 access with fire suppression**
   - Pros: Faster evacuation, maintains primary route, reduces total time
   - Cons: High risk to fire crews, resource intensive, may not be sustainable
   - Impact: High - could save 15-20 minutes
   - Probability: 35%

2. **Immediate evacuation via alternative routes**
   - Pros: Safe for all personnel, guaranteed evacuation, no additional risk
   - Cons: Longer evacuation time, higher traffic congestion, complex coordination
   - Impact: Medium - 23 minute delay
   - Probability: 65%

### 3. Direct Integration
The component can be embedded in other parts of the application as needed.

## Example Queries

### Evacuation Decisions
- "Should we evacuate Pine Valley?"
- "What's the evacuation status for Oak Ridge?"
- "How many people are at risk in Harbor District?"

### Route Analysis
- "What happens if we lose Highway 30?"
- "Are there alternative routes to Downtown?"
- "Which evacuation route is safest?"

### Resource Allocation
- "How many fire units do we need?"
- "Where should we position ambulances?"
- "What's our resource capacity?"

### Hazard Assessment
- "Will the fire reach Downtown?"
- "How fast is the fire spreading?"
- "What's the wind impact on evacuation?"

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# AIP Service Configuration
AIP_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000
