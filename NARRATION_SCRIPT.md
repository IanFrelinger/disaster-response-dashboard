## 📝 **Complete Narration Script**

### **0:00-0:15 - HOOK**
> "In fast-moving disasters, minutes matter. Here's how our tool cuts decision time dramatically."

### **0:15-0:45 - PROBLEM STATEMENT**
> "We picked disaster response because delays cost lives and millions in losses. Emergency managers face fragmented data, slow coordination, and dangerous routing that puts evacuees in harm's way. Our target users - emergency commanders, first responders, and government agencies - need a unified platform that turns chaos into coordinated action."

### **0:45-2:45 - CORE DEMO**

#### **Beat 1: Risk Grid (0:45-1:10)**
> "Here's the demo: live satellite detections roll into a terrain-aware risk grid. NASA FIRMS data, NOAA weather, and ground sensors feed our H3 spatial indexing system, processing millions of data points in seconds. Each hexagon shows real-time risk scoring based on proximity, intensity, and weather conditions."

#### **Beat 2: Hazard-Aware Routes (1:10-1:35)**
> "With one click, we generate safe evacuation routes that avoid advancing fire lines. Our A* algorithm with hazard weights finds optimal paths in real-time. Notice how routes dynamically adjust to avoid danger zones - this is the difference between life and death."

#### **Beat 3: Resource Management (1:35-2:00)**
> "We position engines and medics where they'll have the most impact. Drag units to staging areas and watch ETAs and coverage update instantly. The system optimizes resource allocation based on real-time conditions and predicted needs."

#### **Beat 4: Communications (2:00-2:25)**
> "Targeted alerts reach residents in seconds - with delivery and acknowledgement tracking. Emergency notifications cascade through multiple channels, ensuring no one is left behind. Real-time status updates keep everyone informed."

#### **Beat 5: Adaptive Updates (2:25-2:45)**
> "As conditions change, routes and priorities update automatically. Fire lines shift, wind patterns change, and our system adapts instantly. This is real-time decision support that keeps pace with the disaster."

### **2:45-3:25 - TECHNICAL STACK**
> "Under the hood: a React and Mapbox GL front end for stunning 3D visualization, Python services for real-time analysis with Redis and Celery, scikit-learn for risk and route models, and enterprise data fusion via Foundry to ground decisions in operational data."

### **3:25-3:50 - IMPACT**
> "The result: dramatically faster coordination and meaningful cost avoidance during major events. Our goal: 65 to 90 percent faster emergency coordination, 15 to 75 million dollars saved per major event, and improved evacuation compliance that saves lives."

### **3:50-4:00 - CLOSE**
> "We're seeking pilot partners to validate across regions and hazards. This isn't just technology - it's a lifeline for communities facing disaster."
