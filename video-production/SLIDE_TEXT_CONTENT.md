## TECHNICAL INSERT SLIDES (4 slides)

### **Technical Insert 1A: Data Sources → Foundry → Backend**
**Duration**: 35 seconds
**Chart**: Data flow diagram

**External Data Sources** flow into **Palantir Foundry** for real-time processing:

**FIRMS, NOAA, 911, traffic, GPS** → **Foundry Inputs/Functions/Outputs**

Our **Flask API + Celery + Redis** architecture pulls processed outputs:

**REST APIs** for data access + **WebSockets** for real-time updates

This creates a unified data pipeline that powers all emergency response operations.

---

### **Technical Insert 1B: Processing Engines**
**Duration**: 40 seconds
**Chart**: Processing engines diagram

Three specialized **Processing Engines** power intelligent decision-making:

**HazardProcessor** (ML Forecasting): RandomForest models predict fire spread patterns
**RiskProcessor** (H3 Spatial): H3 resolution-9 hexagons (~174m) for spatial analysis
**RouteOptimizer** (A* Algorithm): Advanced pathfinding with hazard avoidance

Each engine processes data through **Foundry Functions** with real-time updates.

This enables **ML-powered predictions** and **intelligent routing** for emergency response.

---

### **Technical Insert 1C: API Surface → Frontend**
**Duration**: 30 seconds
**Chart**: API surface diagram

**API Surface** connects backend processing to frontend interface:

**/api/hazards** - Active incident data
**/api/hazard_zones** - Spatial risk assessment
**/api/routes** - Optimized evacuation paths
**/api/risk** - Location-specific risk analysis
**/api/evacuations** - Progress tracking
**/api/units** - Resource management
**/api/public_safety** - Public communications

**REST APIs** expose data + **WebSockets** push live events to dashboard

---

### **Technical Insert 2: Request Lifecycle**
**Duration**: 35 seconds
**Chart**: Request lifecycle sequence diagram

**Async Request Lifecycle** for route planning:

**POST /api/routes** → **202 Accepted (jobId)**
**Celery Processing** → **route_ready Event**
**GET /api/routes/:id** → **Geometry/ETA/Distance**

This **asynchronous architecture** enables:
• Complex route calculations without blocking the UI
• Real-time updates via WebSocket events
• Scalable processing for multiple concurrent requests

The system maintains **sub-second response times** while processing complex spatial algorithms.
