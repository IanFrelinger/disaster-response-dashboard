# Dialogue Generation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. PDF Conversion
- Successfully converted "Video presentation plan.pdf" to Markdown format
- Used a custom PDF-to-Markdown converter script with multiple extraction methods
- Preserved document structure and content for further processing

### 2. New Narration Configuration
- Created `new_narration.yaml` based on the video presentation plan content
- Structured for 13 scenes covering the complete 4-minute demo
- Each scene includes:
  - Duration timing
  - Professional narration text
  - Tone specifications
  - Visual reference descriptions

### 3. ElevenLabs TTS Integration
- Successfully integrated with local ElevenLabs service
- Generated high-quality audio for all 13 scenes
- Used voice ID: `EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL` (professional, clear tone)
- Applied consistent audio settings (stability: 0.5, similarity_boost: 0.75)

### 4. Audio Generation Results
- **Total Scenes**: 13/13 successful
- **Total Duration**: 240 seconds (4 minutes)
- **Output Format**: Individual WAV files + merged voiceover
- **File Locations**:
  - Individual scenes: `audio/vo/shot-XX-scene-title.wav`
  - Merged audio: `audio/voiceover.wav`

### 5. New Timeline Configuration
- Created `new_timeline.yaml` that integrates the new dialogue structure
- Updated scene durations to match the video presentation plan
- Enhanced transitions and visual effects for professional presentation
- Added appropriate lower-thirds graphics for each scene
