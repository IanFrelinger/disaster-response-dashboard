  - Data Flow
  - Foundry Integration
  - Metrics
- [ ] Click on components to see details
- [ ] Check technology stack information

## üîç Detailed Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Complete Workflow
1. Start in Zones view
2. Select a high-priority zone
3. Switch to AIP Commander
4. Ask: "What resources are needed for this zone?"
5. Switch to Units view
6. Assign units to the zone
7. Switch to Routing view
8. Plan evacuation routes
9. Return to Zones view to see updates

### Test 2: AI Decision Support
1. Go to AIP Commander
2. Try these queries:
   - "What is the current fire spread rate?"
   - "Which routes are safe for civilian evacuation?"
   - "What is the weather forecast for the next 6 hours?"
3. Verify each response has:
   - Clear recommendation
   - Confidence score
   - Alternative scenarios
   - Data sources

### Test 3: Route Planning
1. Go to Routing view
2. Test each route profile:
   - **Civilian**: Should show maximum safety constraints
   - **EMS**: Should show calculated risk approach
   - **Fire**: Should show direct approach with water sources
   - **Police**: Should show secure transit requirements
3. Toggle deconfliction to see route conflicts

### Test 4: Unit Management
1. Go to Units view
2. Check all unit types are displayed with correct icons
3. Verify status colors match the legend
4. Test view mode switching
5. Click on units to see detailed information

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Components not loading
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, ensure mock data is loaded

### Issue: AI responses not appearing
**Solution**: Wait for the 1.5-second processing time, check network tab

### Issue: Routes not displaying
**Solution**: Verify mock data includes route information, check TypeScript types

### Issue: Unit assignment not working
**Solution**: Ensure drag-and-drop is enabled, check browser compatibility

### Issue: Navigation buttons not responding
**Solution**: Verify viewMode state is properly set, check component props

## üìä Expected Results

### Performance
- **Page Load**: < 3 seconds
- **View Switching**: < 1 second
- **AI Response**: 1.5 seconds
- **Data Updates**: Real-time

### Visual Quality
- **Colors**: iOS Human Interface Guidelines compliant
- **Icons**: Consistent and meaningful
- **Layout**: Responsive and professional
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions

### Functionality
- **All Views**: Accessible and functional
- **Data Display**: Accurate and up-to-date
- **Interactions**: Intuitive and responsive
- **Error Handling**: Graceful and informative

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All 7 view modes are accessible**
‚úÖ **Navigation between views works smoothly**
‚úÖ **Mock data displays correctly in all views**
‚úÖ **AI Commander responds to queries**
