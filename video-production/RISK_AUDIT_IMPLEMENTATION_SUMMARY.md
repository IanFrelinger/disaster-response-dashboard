# Risk Audit Implementation Summary

## 🛡️ Overview
Successfully implemented all risk audit fixes to make the presentation bulletproof against common recruiter probing points. Every claim now matches current implementation and avoids over-promising.

---

## ✅ Risk Audit Fixes Implemented

### **1. Slide 2 - Live Hazard Map**
**✅ FIXED**
- **Before**: "spread predictions"
- **After**: "risk scoring and proximity context"
- **Rationale**: Avoids claiming spread forecasting if not visually demonstrated

### **2. Slide 6 - Building Evacuation Tracker**
**✅ FIXED**
- **Before**: "Integrates with building management systems"
- **After**: "Designed to integrate with building systems; today shows building-level status and progress"
- **Rationale**: Honest about current capabilities while showing future potential

### **3. Slide 8 - Public Safety Communications**
**✅ FIXED**
- **Before**: "Manages emergency alerts and public notifications"
- **After**: "Public Safety panel surfaces status for public communications during crisis events. Pluggable to existing mass-notification systems"
- **Rationale**: Shows current status display capability without claiming active notification publishing

### **4. Slide 9 - Incident Management**
**✅ FIXED**
- **Before**: "Incident Management provides comprehensive oversight"
- **After**: "Incident oversight via map focus, unit assignments and progress panels"
- **Rationale**: Describes actual current functionality rather than claiming dedicated incident management system

### **5. Timing Buffer Optimization**
**✅ FIXED**
- **Public Safety Communications**: 25s → 22s (-3s)
- **Incident Management**: 30s → 27s (-3s)
- **Total Reduction**: 6 seconds for safer real-world pacing
- **New Target**: ~6:15-6:45 minutes (well within 5-7 minute target)

### **6. AIP Training Data Transparency**
**✅ FIXED**
- **Added to Slide**: "Models are trained on historical and synthetic scenarios; we validate continuously against recent events"
- **Added to VO**: Same transparency statement in voice-over
- **Rationale**: Honest about training data sources and validation approach

### **7. Security & Reliability Details**
**✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
- **Analytics & Performance slide includes**:
  - "health checks, structured logging"
  - "caching with hazard-based invalidation"
- **Rationale**: Shows operational maturity and reliability focus

### **8. Data Provenance/Privacy**
**✅ FIXED**
- **Added to Technical Insert**: "Demo uses synthetic/aggregated data; no PII"
- **Rationale**: Preemptively addresses compliance and privacy concerns

## 🎯 Recruiter Probing Points Addressed

| Probing Point | Risk Level | Fix Implemented |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Spread forecasting claims | 🔴 High | Changed to "risk scoring and proximity context" |
| Building system integration | 🔴 High | "Designed to integrate" + current capabilities |
| Notification publishing | 🟡 Medium | "Surfaces status" + "pluggable to existing" |
| Incident management scope | 🟡 Medium | "Oversight via map focus" (actual functionality) |
| Training data sources | 🟡 Medium | Explicit transparency about synthetic/historical data |
| Data privacy/compliance | 🟡 Medium | "Synthetic/aggregated data; no PII" disclaimer |
| Timing buffer | 🟡 Medium | Reduced 6 seconds for safer pacing |
| Security/reliability | 🟢 Low | Already included health checks, logging, caching |
