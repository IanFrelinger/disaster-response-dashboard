**ID:** map_interaction
**Duration:** 50 seconds
**Voice:** alloy
**Emphasis:** Incident Commander, risk analysis, decisions, actions, Foundry workflows
**Audio File:** map_interaction-narration.mp3

**Narration:**
> Here's how an Incident Commander would use the platform. Click on any hazard to see detailed risk analysis, population at risk, and recommended actions. The system shows you exactly what decisions you need to make and provides the data to make them confidently. You can edit hazard zones, update evacuation orders, and coordinate response units - all through Foundry's action workflows.

### Segment 7: ZONE MANAGEMENT & BUILDING STATUS

**ID:** zones
**Duration:** 40 seconds
**Voice:** alloy
**Emphasis:** evacuation zones, building status, real-time, automatic, current
**Audio File:** zones-narration.mp3

**Narration:**
> Managing evacuation zones becomes straightforward with real-time building status tracking. See which buildings are evacuated, which are still occupied, and track evacuation progress. The system automatically updates risk assessments as conditions change, so you always have current information.

---

### Segment 8: A-STAR ROUTE OPTIMIZATION

**ID:** routes
**Duration:** 40 seconds
**Voice:** alloy
**Emphasis:** safe, AI, looks, updating, dangerous, A-Star, optimize
**Audio File:** routes-narration.mp3

**Narration:**
> Get safe evacuation routes with just one click. Our AI looks at the terrain, checks for hazards, and monitors traffic to find the safest way out. The routes keep updating as things change - what was safe ten minutes ago might be dangerous now. The A-Star algorithm considers multiple factors to optimize for safety and speed.
