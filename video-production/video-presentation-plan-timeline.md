Disaster‑Response Demo – Simplified Timeline This streamlined timeline matches the current capabilities of your disaster‑response web app. Because the existing UI only supports the Commander Dashboard, Live Map and basic hazard layers, this outline focuses on those features. Each segment lists the time range, a suggested narration you can customise, a visual to display, and a few production notes using the graphics and transition system. The total runtime is about two minutes to match your latest recording. 0:00–0:10 — Introduction ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Hi, I’m Ian Frelinger, and welcome to my Palantir Building Challenge submission. I’ve built a prototype of a disaster‑response dashboard that helps coordinate emergency operations when every second counts. Visual: Use your abstract swirling artwork to set the mood and hint at the complexity of emergency response. This graphic introduces the viewer to the theme without showing real responders: Production features: • Apply the intro_template from your graphics system to display the title (“Disaster Response Platform”) and subtitle (“Palantir Building Challenge Project”) with a smooth fade‑in. Use the Emergency Response colours (info blue accent) to tie into later scenes. 1

• Start from black with a fade‑in transition ( fade=t=in:st=0:d=1 ), letting the swirling art and titles appear gracefully. 0:10–0:25 — Problem Statement & Motivation ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Emergency responders often juggle radios, maps and spreadsheets. Traditional common operating pictures can overwhelm them with information, and front‑line teams rarely have access to the high‑level tools reserved for Incident Commanders 1 . This project aims to unify critical data in one place without replacing human judgment. Visual: Show the hazard detection map to illustrate the starting point of the problem. The Live Map highlights active hazards, routes, units and evacuation zones: Production features: • Transition to this scene using a crossfade from the introduction. As the hazard map appears, overlay a callout_alert (“Fragmented systems slow response”) with a quick bounce animation to call out the pain point. • Follow with a callout_info listing key issues (“Data overload”, “Manual fusion”, “Limited access”) using the blue colour scheme. Slide it in from the right. 0:25–0:35 — Target User Persona ⏱ Suggested dialogue: 2

This dashboard is built for Incident Commanders, Operations and Planning chiefs, dispatchers and front‑line responders. We keep the Incident Commander at the top of the chain of command 2 but give every role the same real‑time situational awareness. Visual: Display the vector silhouettes representing a firefighter, medic and police officer to make the personas tangible: Production features: • Use a slide‑left transition to bring in this scene. Place label_role boxes above each silhouette (“Commander”, “Planner”, “Responder”) with a subtle fade‑in. • Add a lower third using the lower_third_basic template to show your name (“Ian Frelinger”) and title (“Developer & Presenter”). 0:35–0:50 — Technical Architecture & Data Flow ⏱ Suggested dialogue: The front end uses React and Mapbox to deliver a responsive, 3‑D map. The backend is Python/Flask with WebSockets for live updates. We ingest satellite, weather and population data, fuse it in Foundry, and expose it through an API. This simplified data‑flow diagram shows the path from ingestion through hazard processing into the map. Visual: Use the API data flow diagram you prepared: 3
## Page 4

Production features: • Present this section with the technical_template. Display the diagram with a fade‑in, and place small label_component callouts near “Ingestion”, “Processing”, and “Map” to explain each stage. • Conclude with a brief fade‑out before switching to the dashboard. 0:50–1:10 — Commander Dashboard Overview ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Here’s the Commander Dashboard, which summarises our zones, populations and building counts. Zone A is Immediate, Zone B is Warning, and Zone C is Standby. We can quickly see how many buildings have been evacuated, the total population at risk and any special‑needs residents. Visual: Show the asset management & status view from the dashboard, which includes the zone summary: 4
## Page 5

Production features: • Enter this scene with a slide‑down transition. Use label_component callouts next to Zone A/B/C to display their priority (Immediate, Warning, Standby). Each label should fade in sequentially. • Add a status bar at the bottom using label_status to summarise overall evacuation progress (e.g. “Evacuated: 1 of 3 buildings”). 1:10–1:30 — Live Map & Hazard View ⏱ Suggested dialogue: On the Live Map, hazards appear as red clusters over the city. We can toggle layers for hazards, routes, units and evacuation zones to focus on what matters. This view updates in real time as new detections come in. Visual: Return to the hazard detection map to emphasise the live nature of the system: 5
## Page 6

Production features: • Use a slide‑right transition to bring back the map. Highlight the map layer toggles using a callout_info (“Hazards”, “Routes”, “Units”, “Evac Zones”) arranged vertically. Animate each toggle with a slight scale‑in to draw attention. • Use a zoom‑in (scale) effect centred on one of the hazard clusters to emphasise the threat. Overlay a label_status (“3 hazards active”) near the top. 1:30–1:45 — Simplified Flow & Next Steps ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Because the current UI is a work in progress, today’s demo focuses on the dashboard and live hazard view. Future versions will include zone drawing, hazard‑aware routing, unit assignment and AI recommendations. For now, this prototype proves that we can unify core data sources and present them clearly to the Incident Commander and the team. Visual: Briefly show the operational overview diagram again to hint at what’s coming next: 6
## Page 7

Production features: • Transition into this scene using a crossfade. Display the operational overview with a short fade‑in, then add a callout_info (“Coming soon: Zones, Routes, AI & Units”) that slides up from the bottom. • Use a graphics_fade to end the scene before the conclusion. 1:45–2:07 — Conclusion & Call to Action ⏱ Suggested dialogue: In summary, this prototype shows that real‑time data fusion and a clean interface can accelerate disaster response while keeping the Incident Commander firmly in charge 1 . I’m excited to expand this into a full system—with zones, routing and AI—and would love to explore pilots or collaborations. Visual: Finish with the calming sunrise artwork to leave a hopeful impression: 7
## Page 8

Production features: • Fade out of the previous scene and fade into the sunrise graphic. Use a title_small (“Conclusion & Next Steps”) that scales in gently at the top. Display your contact information or call‑to‑action in a lower third overlay. Let the text linger for a few seconds before fading out, and then end with a final fade to black. How to use this timeline This simplified outline aligns with the limited features in the current UI. It still leverages your production system’s transitions, graphics templates and themes to create a polished, engaging demo. Adjust the wording, visuals or durations as needed, but keep the total runtime around two minutes. When more features are implemented, you can expand the timeline to showcase additional interactions. 1 2 emilms.fema.gov https://emilms.fema.gov/is_0200c/groups/450.html 8
