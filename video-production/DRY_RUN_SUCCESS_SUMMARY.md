- **FPS**: 30
- **Audio**: Disabled (as requested for dry run)

## Key Success Factors
1. **Correct Selectors**: Updated selectors to match actual frontend elements
2. **Proper Timing**: Each beat executed within planned duration
3. **Visual Transitions**: Smooth transitions between Commander Dashboard and Live Map views
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed reporting
5. **Quality Assurance**: Screenshots captured at each beat for verification

## Next Steps
The dry run confirms that the interaction recording system is working perfectly. The next phase would be to:

1. **Add Text-to-Speech**: Integrate narration for each beat
2. **Enhance Transitions**: Add smooth transitions between beats
3. **Add Overlays**: Include presentation text overlays
4. **Final Assembly**: Combine video, audio, and graphics into final presentation

## Files Generated
- **Main Recording**: `a7a8ccd3344b6f392a38f6334a020091.webm`
- **Screenshots**: 14 PNG files (123KB-504KB each)
- **Report**: `dry-run-report.json` with detailed metrics
- **Script**: `dry-run-recorder.ts` (updated with correct selectors)

## Conclusion
The dry run successfully demonstrated that the presentation interaction recording system is fully functional and ready for the next phase of development. All 13 presentation beats were captured exactly as planned, providing a solid foundation for the complete video presentation.
