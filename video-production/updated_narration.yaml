    title: "Introduction"
    duration: 15
    narration: "Hi, I'm excited to share my Palantir Building Challenge project. I've built a disaster-response platform that helps incident commanders and their teams coordinate faster and safer when minutes matter."

    title: "Problem Statement & Motivation"
    duration: 25
    narration: "Emergency responders have to juggle radios, maps, spreadsheets and more, which slows them down when every minute counts. In many cases, lower-level responders lack access to high-level situational awareness and tools reserved for incident commanders. I wanted to build something that brings everyone onto the same page without overloading them with information."

    narration: "This system is designed for Incident Commanders, Operations and Planning chiefs, dispatchers and field units. We keep the Incident Commander at the top of the chain of command but also give front-line teams real-time information and AI-generated recommendations."

    title: "Technical Architecture & API Data Flow"
    duration: 30
    narration: "Under the hood, the front end uses React and Mapbox for a fast, 3-D map. The backend runs on Python/Flask with WebSockets and Celery to handle real-time updates. Everything sits on Palantir Foundry, which streams live data from NOAA, NASA and USGS and powers the AIP assistant. This API data-flow diagram shows how external feeds flow into ingestion and hazard processing. From there, the data drives three core services: route optimisation, ontology and entities, and AI decision support. Arrows point to the public endpoints (safety checks, hazard summaries, evacuation status) and the internal/fusion endpoints (dispatching resources, fused analytics, unit management). By focusing only on the essential components, the diagram stays clean and easy to follow."

    narration: "A satellite feed shows a new fire. The system flags it and scores the risk using population data and weather. As the Incident Commander, I confirm that this is a real incident."

    title: "Triage & Risk Scoring"
    duration: 10
    narration: "Looking at the risk and wind direction, I decide we should evacuate rather than shelter in place. The AI suggests this because the fire is near critical infrastructure."

    narration: "I pick a route profile—civilian, EMS, fire tactical or police—each balancing safety and speed. The blue line you see is a hazard-aware route calculated using A Star search."

    title: "Assign Units & Track Assets"
    duration: 10
    narration: "I assign engines and medics. Dragging units onto the map updates their tasks and travel times. On the right, you can see building status—evacuated, in progress, refused or uncontacted."

  - id: "ai_support"
    title: "AI Support & Replan"
    duration: 20
    narration: "If I have a question, I can ask the AIP assistant something like 'What happens if we lose Highway 30?' and get alternative routes right away. When a new hazard or weather update comes in, the system automatically recalculates and loops back to zone definition."

    title: "Value Proposition & Impact"
    duration: 30
    narration: "This platform speeds up decisions, reduces staffing needed for manual data fusion, and gives every responder a common operating picture while keeping the Incident Commander firmly in control. By automating routine steps, it lets teams focus on actions that save lives and property."

    title: "Foundry Integration & AI Assistance"
    duration: 20
    narration: "Thanks to Foundry's data pipelines and ontology, I can ingest and fuse multiple feeds quickly. The AIP assistant is context-aware because it sits on top of that ontology, so it can recommend re-routing around a blocked highway or predict fire spread."
