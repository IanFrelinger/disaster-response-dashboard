# Recording Script Error Handling Improvements

## Overview
The recording script (`scripts/record.ts`) has been significantly improved to handle recording issues gracefully and return early when critical errors occur. This ensures the pipeline fails fast and provides clear feedback about what went wrong.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Critical Error Tracking
- Added `criticalErrors` array to track severe issues that should stop recording
- Implemented `addCriticalError()` method for consistent error logging
- Added `hasCriticalErrors()` method to check if recording should continue

### 2. Environment Validation
- Added comprehensive environment validation before starting recording
- Checks output directory writability
- Validates configuration file structure
- Ensures required configuration parameters are present

### 3. Graceful Failure Handling
- Browser initialization now returns boolean success/failure
- Navigation failures are caught and logged as critical errors
- Action execution failures are tracked and can stop recording
- File size validation ensures recorded videos meet minimum quality standards

### 4. Early Return on Critical Issues
- Recording stops immediately when critical errors are detected
- Script exits with proper error code (1) when failures occur
- Cleanup is always performed regardless of success/failure
- Results are saved even when recording fails

### 5. Enhanced Error Reporting
- Critical errors are clearly marked with ðŸš¨ emoji
- Detailed error messages include context about what failed
- Results JSON includes critical errors array for debugging
- Console output provides clear indication of failure points

## Error Handling Flow

```
1. Environment Validation â†’ Fail â†’ Exit
2. Browser Initialization â†’ Fail â†’ Exit  
3. App Navigation â†’ Fail â†’ Exit
4. Beat Recording â†’ Check for Critical Errors â†’ Continue/Stop
5. Final Validation â†’ Check for Critical Errors â†’ Success/Failure
6. Cleanup â†’ Always Execute
```

## Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
```bash
pnpm record
# Script runs and exits with code 0 on success
```

### Error Handling
```bash
pnpm record
# Script detects errors and exits with code 1
# Critical errors are logged and results saved
```

### Testing Error Handling
```bash
pnpm test:errors
# Runs comprehensive error handling tests
```

## Configuration Requirements

The script now requires:
- Valid `record.config.json` file
- Writable `captures/` directory
- Valid app URL configuration
- At least one beat defined in configuration

## Benefits

1. **Fails Fast**: Recording stops immediately on critical errors
2. **Clear Feedback**: Users know exactly what went wrong
3. **Resource Management**: Browser resources are properly cleaned up
4. **Debugging Support**: Detailed error logs and results files
5. **Pipeline Integration**: Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
6. **Maintainability**: Structured error handling for long-term maintenance

## Testing

The error handling can be tested using:
- `pnpm test:errors` - Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Manual testing with invalid configurations
- Network failure simulation
- Permission error simulation

## Future Enhancements

- Add retry logic for transient failures
- Implement error recovery strategies
- Add metrics collection for error patterns
- Create automated error scenario testing
