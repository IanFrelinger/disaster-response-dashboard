    title: "Introduction & Problem Context"
    duration: 30
    narration: "Hello, I'm Ian Frelinger, and I built this disaster-response platform for the Palantir Building Challenge. Emergency managers today juggle radios, maps and spreadsheets, which slows them down when minutes matter. Traditional common operating pictures often overload them with data, while front-line responders lack the high-level tools reserved for Incident Commanders. My goal is to bring everyone onto the same page, delivering critical information without replacing professional judgment."

    title: "User Roles & Needs"
    duration: 30
    narration: "Who uses this system? Incident Commanders, Operations and Planning chiefs, dispatchers and field responders. The Incident Commander stays at the top of the chain of command, but everyone else gains high-level situational awareness and AI recommendations. By democratising these tools, front-line teams can act faster and safer, while leadership retains clear authority."

    title: "Data Flow & Technical Overview"
    duration: 40
    narration: "Let's look under the hood. Satellite feeds, weather data and infrastructure maps stream into our ingestion layer. We process them into hazard zones, compute risk scores and run A Star routing to find safe paths. All this happens in real time thanks to Palantir Foundry's pipelines and ontology. The API layer then serves these fused data to our dashboards and AI assistant. When drawing diagrams, we focus on the relevant components to avoid clutter."

  - id: "hazard_detection"
    title: "Hazard Detection & Triage"
    duration: 40
    narration: "On the Live Map, we visualise hazards in real time. Each red circle represents a fire detection or other hazard. We can toggle layers like hazards, routes and evacuation zones. Clicking a hazard shows its intensity and the population at risk. This is where triage happens: based on risk scores, we decide whether to monitor the area, shelter in place or evacuate."

  - id: "zone_management"
    title: "Zone & Building Management"
    duration: 40
    narration: "Back on the dashboard, each card represents an evacuation zone. Here's Zone A with 770 people and three buildings. The progress bars show how many residents have been evacuated versus those still in place. Clicking a zone or building lets you update statuses, see special needs and track refusals. Even though our current UI doesn't draw zones on the map, the concept is clear: prioritise areas based on risk and population, and update building statuses as responders report back."

  - id: "route_profiles"
    title: "Route Profiles & Dispatch Strategy"
    duration: 40
    narration: "Getting people out safely depends on the route. We calculate hazard-aware paths using the A Star algorithm. Different profiles balance safety and speed: Civilian evacuation maximises safety, avoiding hazards with big buffers; EMS response takes calculated risks; Fire tactical goes directly at hazards; Police escort secures the route. Even though the UI doesn't yet let us choose profiles, we can overlay the concept on the map. Notice how the blue path curves around the red hazard zones."

  - id: "ai_decision_support"
    title: "AI Decision Support & Replanning"
    duration: 30
    narration: "When conditions change, the system helps you decide what to do next. In the AIP Commander tab, you can ask natural-language questions like 'What if we lose Highway 30?' The AI analyses hazards, unit availability and traffic, and recommends actions. You can accept a recommendation and replan on the fly. This keeps the Incident Commander in control but adds cognitive horsepower when the situation is fluid."

  - id: "technical_deep_dive"
    title: "Technical Deep Dive & Foundry Integration"
    duration: 40
    narration: "Let's go deeper on the tech. Each hazard detection becomes a point on an H3 grid. We enrich it with weather data, population impact and terrain. A machine-learning model predicts spread probabilities, and we update the ontology with risk levels and relationships. Foundry's pipelines make this possible: they ingest data, run transforms and manage objects like Hazard Zones, Routes and Units. When you issue an evacuation order, the ontology automatically links zones, routes and units, and events propagate across the system. This ensures everyone has a consistent picture."

    title: "Impact & Value Proposition"
    duration: 30
    narration: "By fusing real-time data and AI guidance into one platform, we cut decision times, reduce manual coordination and improve compliance. Imagine evacuation completion increasing from 65% to 90% and response coordination time dropping from hours to minutes. Lower-level responders get tools previously reserved for senior leaders, and the system scales across hazards. Palantir Foundry enables this by managing data relationships and stream processing."

    title: "Conclusion & Next Steps"
    duration: 20
    narration: "In summary, this platform addresses a critical need in emergency response—integrating data, AI and intuitive interfaces so teams can act faster and safer. We've shown how hazards are detected, triaged, and managed; how routes could be planned; and how AI can guide decisions. With Palantir Foundry, this system is ready to scale. Thank you for watching—I'd love to discuss how we can pilot this solution with your team."
