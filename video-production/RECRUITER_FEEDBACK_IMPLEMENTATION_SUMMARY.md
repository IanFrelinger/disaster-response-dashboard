  - "Selecting the right unit reduces time-to-arrival and risk"
  - "Profile-based routing keeps crews out of smoke/closures"
  - "Continuous status cuts uncertainty for command"

### **6. Key APIs Surfaced**
**âœ… IMPLEMENTED**
- **Complete API Coverage**: All requested endpoints included
  - `/api/hazards` - Active incident data
  - `/api/hazard_zones` - Spatial risk assessment  
  - `/api/routes` - Optimized evacuation paths
  - `/api/risk` - Location-specific risk analysis
  - `/api/evacuations` - Progress tracking
  - `/api/units` - Resource management
  - `/api/public_safety` - Public communications

### **7. Strong Narrative & CTA**
**âœ… IMPLEMENTED**
- **Sharp CTA**: Replaced generic "Next steps" with specific action
  - "Schedule a private working session to walk through your scenarios"
  - "Book a 30-minute scenario run-through with your data and SOPs"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements Made

### **Timing Optimization**
- **Reduced from 16 to 15 slides** (merged Analytics + Performance)
- **Target Duration**: Now ~6:30-7:00 minutes (within 5-7 minute target)
- **Optimized durations**: Reduced several slides to fit timeline

### **Content Refinements**
- **Realistic Claims**: Updated Building Evacuation Tracker and Public Safety Communications
- **Security/Reliability**: Added health checks, structured logging, caching details
- **Technical Accuracy**: All claims now match current implementation

### **Visual Enhancements**
- **New Styling Classes**:
  - `.user-action` (green): Shows specific user interactions
  - `.outcome` (orange): Highlights operational benefits
  - `.foundry-callout` (purple): Emphasizes Foundry importance
  - `.h3-callout` (pink): Technical specification callout
