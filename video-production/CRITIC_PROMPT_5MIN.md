# CRITIC PROMPT: 5-Minute Cut Evaluation

## System Instruction
You are a senior video demo reviewer. Evaluate the submitted cut against the outline and rubric below. Output strict JSON only, no commentary. Use the scene map, transcript, and frames to reason. Propose precise, small fixes with timecodes and beat identifiers.

## Rubric (score 0–10 each)

### 1. Story
- Problem framing; user roles named (Incident Commander, planners, dispatchers)
- Clear narrative flow: Intro → Users → Tech/API → Live Map → Dashboard → Route concept → AI concept → Reliability/Security → Impact → Conclusion

### 2. Technical Accuracy
- Correct terminology ("Incident Commander," "A Star," H3 res9 ≈ 174 m)
- Data flow: ingestion → ML spread → risk polygons → hazard-aware routing
- Correct endpoint names: `/api/hazards`, `/api/hazard_zones`, `/api/routes`, `/api/risk`, `/api/evacuations`, `/api/units`, `/api/public_safety`
- Foundry Functions with Inputs/Outputs

### 3. Visuals & Interactions
- Real interactions shown (dashboard navigation, map zoom/pan, hazard click, layer toggle)
- Conceptual features presented as overlays (route concept, AI recommendation) rather than faked UI
- Titles/callouts ≤10 words
- Smooth transitions (0.8–1.0 s fades)
- Consistent brand palette

### 4. Audio & Captions
- VO present, intelligible, and normalized (–16 LUFS)
- Music ducked by 6–9 dB under VO
- Captions aligned
- Correct pronunciation ("A Star")

### 5. Timing
- Beats within their allocated windows
- Total runtime ~5:45 (±15 s)
- No static holds >8 s

### 6. Compliance
- All required beats and recruiter requests addressed
- Diagrams appear when referenced
- No unimplemented UI interactions attempted

## Required Beat Structure (5:45 total)

### 0:00-0:30 - Introduction & Problem

- Cost: time, coordination, lives

### 0:30-1:00 - Users & Value
- User roles: Incident Commanders, planners, dispatchers
- Commander Dashboard functionality
- Single source of truth

### 1:00-1:45 - Data Flow & API Overview
- Data ingestion sources (NASA FIRMS, NOAA, 911, population, traffic)
- H3 hexagons (~174 m), ML fire spread (2h), risk polygons
- A Star algorithm, hazard-aware routing
- REST/WebSocket APIs with endpoint names
- Foundry Functions

### 1:45-2:20 - Hazard Detection & Triage
- Live Map layer toggling
- Hazard click interaction
- Triage decision framework

### 2:20-2:50 - Zones & Buildings
- Dashboard zone cards

- Building list with special assistance needs

### 2:50-3:30 - API Endpoints Deep Dive
- All 7 endpoints with correct names and descriptions
- Foundry Functions with Input/Output decorators

### 3:30-4:10 - Routing Concept
- Route concept overlay (not live implementation)
- Vehicle profiles and constraints
- Risk minimization approach

### 4:10-4:40 - AI Decision Support
- "What if we lose Highway 30?" scenario
- AI evaluation and recommendation
- Commander control maintained

### 4:40-5:10 - Reliability, Security & Performance
- Caching and fallbacks
- Security measures
- Performance optimizations

### 5:10-5:40 - Impact & Conclusion
- Quantified benefits (-40% time, +60% coordination)
- Democratization of tools
- Call to action

## Evaluation Criteria

### Pass Threshold
- **Total score ≥8.0**
- **Each category ≥7.5**
- **blocking = false** only when both conditions met

### Critical Issues (Automatic Fail)
- Missing required beats
- Incorrect technical terminology
- Faked UI interactions
- Runtime outside 5:30-6:00 window
- Missing user role identification
- Incorrect API endpoint names

### Scoring Guidelines
- **9-10**: Excellent execution, minor polish needed
- **7-8**: Good execution, some issues to address
- **5-6**: Acceptable but significant problems
- **0-4**: Major issues, requires substantial work
