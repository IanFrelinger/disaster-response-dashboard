Disaster‑Response Demo – Extended Narrative Timeline This document lays out an extended five‑plus minute narrative for your Palantir Disaster Response demo. It follows the same style as earlier timelines, using time‑block sections with suggested narration, visuals, and production notes. Feel free to fine‑tune the durations slightly, but aim for a total runtime of roughly 5 minutes 40 seconds. Each section clearly states what the viewer hears, what they see, and how to use the production system’s templates and transitions to polish the presentation. 0:00–0:30 — Introduction & Problem Context ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Hello, I’m Ian Frelinger, and I built this disaster‑response platform for the Palantir Building Challenge. Emergency managers today juggle radios, maps and spreadsheets, which slows them down when minutes matter. Traditional common operating pictures often overload them with data, while front‑line responders lack the high‑level tools reserved for Incident Commanders 1 . My goal is to bring everyone onto the same page, delivering critical information without replacing professional judgment. Visual: Open with the abstract swirling graphic you generated for the intro. It evokes the complexity of emergency response without showing any real‑world scenes: 1
## Page 2

Production features: • Apply the intro_template from your graphics templates to display the main title (“Disaster Response Platform”) and subtitle (“Palantir Building Challenge Project”) with a fade‑in animation. Use the Emergency Response colour palette (info blue and neutral grey) for the text and the semi‑transparent box. • Start with a fade‑in transition from black ( fade=t=in:st=0:d=1 ) to gently introduce the scene. Keep the intro artwork static while the title animates, then crossfade into the next section. 0:30–1:00 — User Roles & Needs ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Who uses this system? Incident Commanders, Operations and Planning chiefs, dispatchers and field responders. The Incident Commander stays at the top of the chain of command 2 , but everyone else gains high‑level situational awareness and AI recommendations. By democratising these tools, front‑line teams can act faster and safer, while leadership retains clear authority. Visual: Use the generic responder illustration to introduce the different personas. The simple silhouettes of a firefighter, medic and police officer hint at the variety of users: Production features: • Transition into this scene with a slide‑left effect to indicate a new topic. The silhouettes should slide in from the right edge. 2

• Overlay label_role boxes above each persona with the role names (“Incident Commander”, “Planner”, “Responder”) using the Emergency Response theme colours. Each label fades in over 0.5 seconds. • Optionally add a lower third at the bottom left with your name (“Ian Frelinger”) and title (“Developer & Presenter”) using the lower_third_basic template. 1:00–1:40 — Data Flow & Technical Overview ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Let’s look under the hood. Satellite feeds, weather data and infrastructure maps stream into our ingestion layer. We process them into hazard zones, compute risk scores and run A Star routing to find safe paths. All this happens in real time thanks to Palantir Foundry’s pipelines and ontology. The API layer then serves these fused data to our dashboards and AI assistant. When drawing diagrams, we focus on the relevant components to avoid clutter 3 . Visual: Display the API data‑flow diagram to show how external feeds flow into ingestion, hazard processing, route optimisation, AI/ontology and finally the API layer: Also consider adding the operational overview diagram showing the Incident Commander above Planning and Operations to reinforce the chain‑of‑command concept: 3
## Page 4

Production features: • Use a slide‑up transition from the previous scene, with the diagram sliding up onto the screen while the personas slide down and disappear. • Highlight each stage of the diagram as you discuss it by animating a glowing outline or subtle colour change around the relevant component. You can implement this using callouts or labels with the label_component template. • Keep the diagram on screen for at least 10 seconds so viewers can digest the flow. Use a graphics_fade transition to gently fade the diagram out when moving to the next scene. 1:40–2:20 — Hazard Detection & Triage ⏱ Suggested dialogue: On the Live Map, we visualise hazards in real time. Each red circle represents a fire detection or other hazard. We can toggle layers like hazards, routes and evacuation zones. Clicking a hazard shows its intensity and the population at risk. This is where triage happens: based on risk scores, we decide whether to monitor the area, shelter in place or evacuate. Visual: Show the Live Map with hazards highlighted, using the hazard detection screenshot. Demonstrate clicking a hazard marker and toggling layers: 4
## Page 5

Production features: • Transition into this scene with a crossfade, merging the API diagram with the map view. As the map fades in, animate a callout_alert (“New Hazard Detected”) at the centre, bouncing briefly before fading. • Use the bounce animation to draw attention to the hazard when you click on it. If possible, add a tiny pulsating glow around the selected marker while its details appear. • Overlay a status indicator (from label_status ) at the bottom to show the current risk level (e.g., “Risk: High”) with a slide‑up animation. 2:20–3:00 — Zone & Building Management ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Back on the dashboard, each card represents an evacuation zone. Here’s Zone A with 770 people and three buildings. The progress bars show how many residents have been evacuated versus those still in place. Clicking a zone or building lets you update statuses, see special needs and track refusals. Even though our current UI doesn’t draw zones on the map, the concept is clear: prioritise areas based on risk and population, and update building statuses as responders report back. Visual: Use the dashboard overview and building cards, referencing the asset management screenshot. Show the zone cards and building status counts: 5
## Page 6

Production features: • Slide into this scene using a slide‑down transition. The map view moves up and off screen while the dashboard scrolls into view. • Highlight the progress bars with subtle fill animations so viewers can see them “fill up” as you describe evacuees leaving. Use the label_status template near each bar to show counts like “Evacuated: 1 / In Progress: 2”. • If you want to hint at the unimplemented zone‑drawing feature, add a small callout_info (“Dynamic zone editing coming soon”) to manage expectations. 3:00–3:40 — Route Profiles & Dispatch Strategy ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Getting people out safely depends on the route. We calculate hazard‑aware paths using the A Star algorithm. Different profiles balance safety and speed: Civilian evacuation maximises safety, avoiding hazards with big buffers; EMS response takes calculated risks; Fire tactical goes directly at hazards; Police escort secures the route. Even though the UI doesn’t yet let us choose profiles, we can overlay the concept on the map. Notice how the blue path curves around the red hazard zones. Visual: Superimpose a hazard‑aware route over the map. Use the route planning screenshot to illustrate the A Star path avoiding hazards: 6
## Page 7

Production features: • Transition into this scene with a wipe effect from left to right, revealing the map with the route overlay. • Use a callout_info panel on the right to summarise the four profiles. The panel can slide in from the right edge, with each profile appearing one after another (typewriter animation optional). • Animate the route drawing using a wipe animation or reveal, so viewers can see the line draw from origin to destination, hugging the hazard buffers. 3:40–4:10 — AI Decision Support & Replanning ⏱ Suggested dialogue: When conditions change, the system helps you decide what to do next. In the AIP Commander tab, you can ask natural‑language questions like “What if we lose Highway 30?” The AI analyses hazards, unit availability and traffic, and recommends actions. You can accept a recommendation and replan on the fly. This keeps the Incident Commander in control but adds cognitive horsepower when the situation is fluid. Visual: Show the AIP Commander interface. Type a sample query into the input field and imagine a recommendation card appearing: 7
## Page 8

Production features: • Use a slide‑up transition to reveal the AI tab. The map slides down and the AI interface slides up. • Animate the typing with a typewriter effect so each character appears sequentially. After the question is typed, fade in a callout showing the hypothetical recommendation (“Evacuate via Route 3; stage EMS at Oak Ridge”). • Finish this scene with a crossfade into the next deep‑dive section. 4:10–4:50 — Technical Deep Dive & Foundry Integration ⏱ Suggested dialogue: Let’s go deeper on the tech. Each hazard detection becomes a point on an H3 grid. We enrich it with weather data, population impact and terrain. A machine‑learning model predicts spread probabilities, and we update the ontology with risk levels and relationships. Foundry’s pipelines make this possible: they ingest data, run transforms and manage objects like Hazard Zones, Routes and Units. When you issue an evacuation order, the ontology automatically links zones, routes and units, and events propagate across the system. This ensures everyone has a consistent picture. Visual: Revisit the API data‑flow diagram, but zoom into the hazard processing section and annotate it. You can also briefly show the role swimlane diagram to illustrate how different actors interact over time: 8
## Page 9

Production features: • Use a graphics_scale transition to zoom in on the hazard processing box in the API diagram. Add small labels for H3 indexing, ML prediction and ontology updates using the label_component template. • Layer the swimlane diagram on top of the diagram with a dissolve or fade effect, and highlight the row corresponding to the Incident Commander to show how orders propagate. • Keep the diagrams on screen for 15 seconds while you describe the tech; then crossfade back to the dashboard for the next segment. 9

4:50–5:20 — Impact & Value Proposition ⏱ Suggested dialogue: By fusing real‑time data and AI guidance into one platform, we cut decision times, reduce manual coordination and improve compliance. Imagine evacuation completion increasing from 65 % to 90 % and response coordination time dropping from hours to minutes. Lower‑level responders get tools previously reserved for senior leaders, and the system scales across hazards. Palantir Foundry enables this by managing data relationships and stream processing 1 . Visual: Use the asset management dashboard again to remind viewers of the progress bars and counts. Overlay simple bar or line charts representing improvements (e.g., evac completion rate or response time). Use professional chart templates or the callout_success template to highlight the value. Production features: • Use a fade‑through‑black or transition_smooth effect to move into this scene. Present a bar chart that animates upward, using the callout_success template to call out key metrics. • Maintain the Emergency Response colour scheme and professional typography. Conclude the visuals by emphasising the key numbers with bold text or coloured accents. 5:20–5:40 — Conclusion & Next Steps ⏱ Suggested dialogue: In summary, this platform addresses a critical need in emergency response—integrating data, AI and intuitive interfaces so teams can act faster and safer. We’ve shown how hazards are detected, triaged, and managed; how routes could be planned; and how AI can guide decisions. With Palantir Foundry, this system is ready to scale. Thank you for watching—I’d love to discuss how we can pilot this solution with your team. Visual: End with the hopeful sunrise artwork you generated. It’s a calm, optimistic image that symbolises new beginnings after a disaster: 10
## Page 11

Production features: • Fade out the previous scene and fade in the conclusion image. Use the fade‑in effect for the text (“Thank you” and a brief call‑to‑action). Keep the final image on screen for at least 5 seconds to let the message sink in. • Add a lower third with your contact details or a link to continue the conversation. The lower third should gently slide up from the bottom and then fade out. This extended timeline weaves together real interactions, conceptual explanations and diagrams. It preserves the narrative requested by your recruiter—why you chose this problem, who the users are, how the system works, and what value it delivers—while fitting within a longer video. You can adjust durations or swap visuals as needed, but following this structure will help you deliver a comprehensive, professional demo. 1 2 emilms.fema.gov https://emilms.fema.gov/is_0200c/groups/450.html 3 API Flow Diagram: Best Practices & Examples | Multiplayer https://www.multiplayer.app/distributed-systems-architecture/api-flow-diagram/ 11
