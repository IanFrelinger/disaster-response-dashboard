      - "3D terrain visualization"
      - "Timer countdown"
      - "Hazard layers"

  - name: "Problem Statement"
    start_time: "0:15"
    end_time: "0:45"
    narration: "We picked disaster response because delays cost lives and millions in losses. Emergency managers face fragmented data, slow coordination, and dangerous routing that puts evacuees in harm's way. Our target users - emergency commanders, first responders, and government agencies - need a unified platform that turns chaos into coordinated action."
    visual_cues:
      - "Problem slide with statistics"
      - "Who suffers, what's broken, target users"
    on_screen_labels:
      - "45-minute â†’ 15-second evacuation orders"
      - "80-150 lives saved annually"

  - name: "Demo - Risk Grid"
    start_time: "0:45"
    end_time: "1:10"
    narration: "Here's the demo: live satellite detections roll into a terrain-aware risk grid. NASA FIRMS data, NOAA weather, and ground sensors feed our H3 spatial indexing system, processing millions of data points in seconds. Each hexagon shows real-time risk scoring based on proximity, intensity, and weather conditions."

  - name: "Demo - Hazard-Aware Routes"
    start_time: "1:10"
    end_time: "1:35"
    narration: "With one click, we generate safe evacuation routes that avoid advancing fire lines. Our A* algorithm with hazard weights finds optimal paths in real-time. Notice how routes dynamically adjust to avoid danger zones - this is the difference between life and death."
    visual_cues:
      - "Draw zone"
      - "A* hazard-aware routes animate in"

    start_time: "1:35"
    end_time: "2:00"
    narration: "We position engines and medics where they'll have the most impact. Drag units to staging areas and watch ETAs and coverage update instantly. The system optimizes resource allocation based on real-time conditions and predicted needs."

  - name: "Demo - Adaptive Updates"
    start_time: "2:25"
    end_time: "2:45"
    narration: "As conditions change, routes and priorities update automatically. Fire lines shift, wind patterns change, and our system adapts instantly. This is real-time decision support that keeps pace with the disaster."
