# 🏔️ Simplified 3D Terrain Application

## Overview

The application has been simplified to focus exclusively on the 3D terrain visualization. All other components (tactical map, main dashboard, etc.) have been removed, making the 3D terrain demo the primary and only feature.

## 🎯 Application Focus

### **Single Purpose**
- **3D Terrain Visualization**: Full-featured 3D terrain with building footprints and vegetation
- **Building Heights**: Realistic 3D buildings with proper height scaling
- **Vegetation System**: Trees, forests, brush, and grass with natural distribution
- **Interactive Controls**: Elevation adjustment, location presets, 2D/3D toggle

## 🚀 Access

### **Primary URL**
**http://localhost:3000**

This now directly loads the 3D terrain demo as the main application.

### **Alternative URL**
**http://localhost:3000/terrain-3d**

Same 3D terrain demo accessible via direct route.

## 📊 Data Structure

### **Building Data**
```typescript
interface Building {
  id: string;
  coordinates: [number, number];
  height: number;
  width: number;
  length: number;
  type: 'residential' | 'commercial' | 'industrial' | 'government';
}
```

### **Vegetation Data**
```typescript
interface Vegetation {
  id: string;
  coordinates: [number, number];
  type: 'tree' | 'forest' | 'brush' | 'grass';
  density: number;
  height: number;
}
```
