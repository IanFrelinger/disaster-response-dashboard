## üåü Life-Saving Impact Story

### The Maria Garcia Story
**August 8, 2023 - Maui Wildfire**

**With Foundry (What Could Have Been):**
- 11:47 AM: Satellite detects heat signature
- 11:48 AM: Foundry transform processes data
- 11:49 AM: Hazard zone created in Ontology
- 11:50 AM: AIP predicts fire spread to Lahaina
- 11:51 AM: Evacuation order issued
- 11:52 AM: Routes optimized for 3,241 residents
- 11:53 AM: Emergency units dispatched
- 11:54 AM: Public notifications sent
- **Result: Maria Garcia saved, 100% evacuation success**

**Without Foundry (Reality):**
- 12:30 PM: First 911 call received
- 12:45 PM: Manual evacuation order issued
- 01:15 PM: Fire reaches Lahaina
- 01:30 PM: Maria Garcia trapped in home
- 02:00 PM: Maria Garcia dies
