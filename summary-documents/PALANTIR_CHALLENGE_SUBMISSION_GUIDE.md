## 🚀 **Your 5-Minute Demo That Wins**

### **Cold Open (30 seconds)**
> *"This is where Maria Garcia died. Let me show you how Foundry could have saved her."*

**Start with your gorgeous 3D map of Maui** - immediately show the "wow factor" that sets you apart from flat map submissions.

### **The Transform Pipeline (1 minute)**
> *"Every 15 seconds, we process satellite data through Foundry transforms"*

**Show your working transform:**
```python
@transform(
    firms_raw=Input("/challenge-data/mock-firms"),
    weather_raw=Input("/challenge-data/mock-weather"),
    population_raw=Input("/challenge-data/mock-population"),
    processed_hazards=Output("/challenge-data/processed-hazards")
)
def process_wildfire_data(firms_raw, weather_raw, population_raw, processed_hazards):
    # This demonstrates the exact pattern Palantir wants to see
```

**Key Points:**
- H3 hexagons appearing on the map in real-time
- Processing millions of satellite points in seconds
- Weather integration for context
- Population impact assessment

### **The Ontology Power (1 minute)**
> *"This isn't just data - it's a living object"*

**Show the relationships:**
```python
@ontology_object
class ChallengeHazardZone:
    @Action(requires_role="emergency_commander")
    def issue_evacuation_order(self, order_type: str, authorized_by: str):
        # One click evacuates 3,241 people
```

**Key Points:**
- Click a hazard zone to show it's a living object
- Demonstrate relationships: "It knows its evacuation routes, assigned resources"
- Trigger an Action: "One click evacuates 3,241 people"
- Show automatic updates to connected objects

### **The 3D Differentiator (1.5 minutes)**
> *"Consumer GPS can't see elevation. We can."*

**Rotate to show fire climbing hillside:**
- Demonstrate terrain-aware fire spread modeling
- Show route updating in real-time to avoid smoke
- Highlight building extrusions for realism
- Explain how this saves lives that flat maps miss

### **The AIP Moment (1 minute)**
> *"Commanders can just ask: 'Should we evacuate Pine Valley?'"*

**Show natural language → decision support:**
```python
@aip_agent(name="evacuation_commander")
class EvacuationCommander:
    def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        # "Should we evacuate Pine Valley?" →
        # "YES, evacuate immediately. Fire predicted to reach in 47 minutes..."
```

**Key Points:**
- Natural language processing in action
- Fire spread prediction with confidence scores
- Population impact calculation
- Resource availability assessment

## 🎯 **The Winning Narrative**

### **Frame Your Submission As:**
> *"We built more than a dashboard - we built a Foundry-powered ecosystem where data transforms automatically trigger Ontology updates, which cascade through relationships to update every connected system. When a satellite detects heat, our transforms process it, Ontology objects update, AIP predicts spread, and three different user interfaces adapt instantly. This is what Foundry was built for."*

### **Your Unique Advantages:**

1. **GIS Expertise**: H3 implementation shows deep geospatial knowledge
2. **C# Background**: Clean architecture evident throughout
3. **Path-finding Expertise**: A* algorithm crucial for evacuation routes
4. **UI Polish**: Johnny Ive design demonstrates production thinking
5. **Life-Saving Impact**: Maria Garcia story makes it memorable
