## 🎯 **The Winning Narrative**

> "We built more than a dashboard - we built a Foundry-powered ecosystem where data transforms automatically trigger Ontology updates, which cascade through relationships to update every connected system. When a satellite detects heat, our transforms process it, Ontology objects update, AIP predicts spread, and three different user interfaces adapt instantly. This is what Foundry was built for."
